Write string to stdout
Writes the C string pointed by str to the standard o
utput (stdout) and appends a newline character ('\n').
The function begins copying from the address specified 
(str) until it reaches the terminating null character ('\0'). 
This terminating null-character is not copied to the stream.
Notice that puts not only differs from fputs in that it uses 
stdout as destination, but it also appends a newline character
 at the end automatically (which fputs does not).
